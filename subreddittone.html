<h3>Subreddit Tone Analysis</h3>

<p><b>Commentary:</b>\n    The following is an academic project done in my Computational Semantics class at UT Austin. The goal of this project was to demonstrate computational linguistic skills, so, in my opinion, my thesis was weak and vague. All the mathematics and programming is solid.<p>

<p><b>Report Text:</b>\n    I want to find if it is possible to computationally sort subreddits by their discussion tone or mood, rather than by topic.\nTo do this, I had to get a lot of data from reddit. This was a lengthy, but easy process. Reddit has a fantastic API, and a number of user made libraries allow easier access to it. I used PRAW, Python Reddit Api Wrapper. It converted to python and it automatically dealt with the rate limiting. I systematically scraped twenty subreddits for current hot posts and downloaded their comments. In the end, I was left with 20 .txt files ranging from just under a megabyte to only 15 kb, depending on the brevity of the subreddit. In all, from each subreddit I scraped about two hundred thousand words from each. This data was spread over a variety of subreddits chosen based on my own knowledge of the site.\nBefore any analysis could be done, I had to extensively preprocess the data. Reddit uses mostly informal writing, which is rich in non-text like emojis, links, etc. I removed errata, removed stops and lemmatized the texts before they could be analyzed. This all cut the data down by about a third. \nI started my analysis using a simple word frequency test. I expected to find mostly topical words, but I also hoped to find some discussion type ones further down in the frequency chart. Next, for a more complex analysis, I did a TF-IDF vectorization. My reasoning was that tone would possibly be represented by a pattern of words used to facilitate longer and more reasoned discussion. This vectorization was then fit to the data, then reduced dimensionally using LSA. Once the numbers had been found, I plotted them on a simple chart. </p>
