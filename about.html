<h3>More About Me</h3>

<p>Hi, I'm Zach Holsinger. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin(Hook em' Horns!), with a BA in Linguistics and minor in Computer Science. My course schedule focused on Computational Linguistics.<br><br>I currently live in Palo Alto, but have soft plans to return to Austin, where my identical twin Alex lives and works. Outside of my career interests, I like map-based video games, dungeons and dragons, middle age history, and the television show Community. <br><br> I'm not much of a social media fan, but you can find me on linkedin <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachholsinger/">here!</a><br><br><br> Note: I am not a web dev, please excuse the current state(read: no CSS) of this site.</p>
