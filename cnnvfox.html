<h3>Dialect Alternation by Expected Audience: Fox vs CNN</h3>

<p><b>Commentary:</b><br>    The following is a project done for my Dialects class at UT Austin. The end goal of this project was to ifnd something about dialects in the United States and demostrate knowledge of dialects. It was therefore not done to the highest mathematical rigor. I eyeballed the target sound change and used  less data than was statistically significant. The computational linguistics within is still solid.</p>
	
<p><b>Report Text:</b><br>    During the 2020 elections, polarization between the two dominant American parties reached a height not seen since the Civil War. The increasing divide was intertwined with a similarly polarized media climate. Despite the framers of the Constitution's best efforts, modern political parties are deeply ingrained into American identities. It is likely that with this identity come certain common dialectic traits based on the makeup of the political party. While a true “Republican” dialect, for example, is unlikely to exist and even less likely to be found by this investigation, it is not unreasonable that a savvy speaker would attempt to take on a few of the vowel expressions used by their expected audience to endear themselves. These expressions are likely to be some kind of composite of the dialects where the parties are based. This project examines a chosen speaker-- Mayor Pete Buttigieg, prominent Biden surrogate and former primary candidate-- in his appearances on Fox News and other Republican leaning outlets versus CNN and Democrat outlets, to assess whether or not a speaker’s dialect changes based on the accent of their expected audience. Mayor Buttigieg was chosen for his uncommon quality of appearing on both types of outlet. </p>

I sourced my audio primarily from town halls for CNN and interviews for Fox. I transcribed about half an hour of quality speech audio using praat and ran DARLA’s Automatic Vowel Extractor on it. After a significant amount of time and a handful of errors, I received my formant data in a comma separated values file for both my CNN and Fox audio. I averaged F1 and F2 formant data for each and then averaged all of each outlet, then created two Mean Composite Vowel Spaces that I could analyze. </p></div>

<p>A pin-pen merger can be seen visually in the kind of Vowel Space I created if the “IH” vowel and the “EH” vowel are closer together. It looked to me like they were slightly closer horizontally. A good sign, but not nearly useful enough. I decided to calculate it, as I had enough data to calculate formants in different environments. Pin-pen merged speech should have a significant decrease in the distance between “IH” and “EH” prenasally and non-prenasally. I made a spreadsheet to calculate the average prenasal formants for each set and compared their relative distances to each other. The distance between the IH vowel and the EH vowel decreases by twenty four in Fox, and by only one in CNN. In Fox news appearances, the speaker does appear to affect the pin pen merger. This piece of evidence supports my hypothesis-- the speaker takes on relatively different speech based on the speech of the expected audience.</p>
